## **Varibles Used :**


| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| mun | Municipality |
| imds | Municipal Sustainable Development Index |
| sdg4_6_lr | Literacy rate for (>= 15 years), 2012 (%) |
| sdg7_1_ec | Electricity coverage, 2012 (% of population) |
| urbano_2012 | Urbanization rate, 2012 |


A group of researchers wanted to understand differences found in municipalities with varying levels of sustainable development. They used the Municipal Sustainable Development Index, to identify the three highest and lowest sustainable development areas. They then used a bar plot to visualize the data and found that the high sustainable development areas had scores in the range of 70 to 80, while the low sustainable development areas had scores in the range of 30 to 40, indicating a significant difference.

Next, they wanted to use the same factors to investigate areas with low sustainable development. They plotted the data using another group bar plot and observed a stark contrast. The areas with low sustainable development had lower literacy rates and poorer electricity coverage. Additionally, the urbanization rates were also lower in these areas, indicating a lack of development.

This analysis highlights the importance of urbanization to advance sustainable development, while also emphasizing the need to address other factors such as access to electricity and education. The correlation matrix helps to provide a clear understanding of the relationships between these variables and their impact on sustainable development, ultimately aiding in the development of more effective policies and strategies to promote sustainable development.

The researcher found that all the factors they were interested in had similar levels of importance, but urbanization had the strongest correlation with sustainable development, followed by electricity coverage and literacy rates. However, the differences between these correlations were relatively small.
