## **Varibles Used :**
| Variable Name | Description |
| :-- | :-: |
| <b>imds</b>|Municipal Sustainable Development Index|
|<b>sdg2_2_cmc</b>|Chronic malnutrition in children (< 5 years), 2016 (%)|
|<b>sdg3_2_mrc</b>|Children mortality rate in (< 5 years), 2016 (per. 1,000 live births)|
|<b>index_sdg1</b>|Rate of contribution to the no poverty goal|
|<b>sdg1_4_abs</b>|Access to the 3 basic services, 2012 (% of households)|


A researchers tried to understand the difference in health area in cities with varying rates of sustainable development. Municipal Sustainable development index (imds) was used to identify 5 cities with highest and 5 cities with lowest levels of sustainable development in Bolivia. The bar plot was visualized and it was determined that cities with high sustainable development had scores from 70 to 80, while cities with low sustainable development had scores from 30 to 40, showing a significant difference in development.

The heatmap visualization was used to identify healthcare variables that strongly correlated with sustainable development index. It was determined that Children mortality rate and Chronic Malnutrition rates in children are variables that have the strongest and negative correlation with Municipal Sustainable development index in Bolivia areas.
Furthemore it was also identified that both Children mortality and Chronic Malnutrition rates have strong and negative relationship with Access to 3 basic services (sanitation, water and energy) and No poverty index (sdg1). As these variables increase, instances of healthcare issues decrease in Bolivia.

Two scatterplot diagrams were created to show the negative relationship between health care indicators (child mortality & malnutrition) and municipal sustainable development index in Bolivia.
Both scatterplot graphs also show strong negative correlation between healthcare indicators and sustainable development index in Bolivia.

Barplot visualization was used to analyze the differences in patterns of health variables in 5 cities with the highest levels of sustainable development and 5 cities with the lowest levels of sustainable development. It was determined that there is a significant difference in instances of chronic malnutrition and mortality rates among children between highly developed and least developed cities in Bolivia. 
Cities with the lowest rates of sustainable development have much higher rates of children mortality and chronic malnutrition than cities with the highest levels of sustainable development.

Next, researchers wanted to understand to what extent a lack of access to basic three services and high poverty rate causes a high instances of child mortality and chronic malnutrition in least developed cities of Bolivia. Furthermore, it was also important to understand if no-poverty and access to three basic services indexes are high in the most developed cities.

Using the bar plot visualization, it was showed that cities with the high sustainable development have relatively high access to sanitation, water and energy. Along with that, the no-poverty index is very high in the most developed areas, which shows that cities with the highest sustainable development levels have low rates of poverty by population. Oppositely, cities with the lowest rate of sustainable development suffer from a lack of access to three basic services and a high poverty, as contribution to the no-poverty goal is very low in such cities. 

High poverty rates and lack of access to life-important services causes high instances of child mortality rates and chronic malnutrition rates in Bolivia areas with the lowest levels of sustainable development. Cities with the highest sustainable development levels have a high rates of access to three basic services and low poverty and therefore these cities do not have high rates of children chronic malnutrition and mortality.
