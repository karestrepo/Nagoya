Bolivia, a high-altitude country located in the Andes Mountains, offers visitors a unique blend of indigenous cultures, colonial architecture, and breathtaking natural beauty. However, despite its many strengths, Bolivia faces significant challenges in its education system. In the story that follows, we will take a journey through the education system, exploring different aspects that affect the students and teachers. Our journey begins in 2012, where we delve into the literacy rate of different states of Bolivia.

Despite having a high literacy rate, only a small percentage of the population had a higher level of education, which could be attributed to poverty and a lack of access to education. This would indicate that the population knows how to read and write but very few people in the population attended college or university. The main reason behind this could be poverty. Many children have to go to work and support their impoverished family rather than go to school. *(Top 4 Reasons Education in Bolivia Lags, 2015)*
 
Let's take a leap forward in time to 2016, when we take a closer look at the state of schools and colleges in Bolivia. It's worth noting that this was also the year when Kuaa computers were distributed to schools, which had a significant impact on education in Bolivia.
 
First, we plot the number of qualified teachers in primary schools, and we divide the numbers based on the states.

![Qualified teachers in initial level](stories/anushka-vuppala-1/IMG2.png)

Our analysis reveals that most states in Bolivia have a high proportion of qualified teachers, with the median always surpassing the average. Notably, the capital city of La Paz stands out with all its districts boasting highly qualified teachers, resulting in the highest median across all states.
 
We also draw a similar plot for qualified teachers in secondary school below:

The secondary school data provides more interesting insights than the primary school data. In comparison to the primary schools, the numbers of qualified teachers in secondary schools are generally lower in each state, and even the capital city of La Paz has a lower median. This could be due to factors such as widespread poverty and teachers going on strikes to demand higher wages and better working conditions, leaving schools with limited resources. Additionally, most schools in Bolivia do not provide meals, require uniforms, or offer school buses and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, the language of instruction in most schools is Spanish, which may hinder students from acquiring English proficiency, a disadvantage in the global education arena. *(Bolivia Education - Bolivia School, n.d.)*
 
Although Bolivia has access to computer resources and highly qualified teachers, the proportion of individuals with advanced education and the literacy rate persist at low levels. Therefore, while Bolivia has the potential to scale up its education system, several challenges need to be addressed to ensure that more students can benefit from quality education.
